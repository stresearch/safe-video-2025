## üìä Overview

To advance the state of the art in audio forensics, we are launching a funded evaluation challenge at [IH&MMSEC2025](https://www.ihmmsec.org) to drive innovation in detecting and attributing synthetic and manipulated audio artifacts. This challenge will focus on several critical aspects, including generalizability across diverse audio sources, robustness against evolving synthesis techniques, and computational efficiency to enable real-world applications. The rapid advancements in audio synthesis, fueled by the increasing availability of new generators and techniques, underscore the urgent need for effective solutions to authenticate audio content and combat emerging threats. Sponsored by the ULRI Digital Safety Research Institute, this initiative aims to mobilize the research community to address this pressing issue.

## üìù Tasks  

The competition will consist of three detection tasks. For each task, the object is to detect if an audio file contains machine generated speech. Not all tasks will be open at the same time. 
- Practice (‚úÖ Open): A practice task to troubleshoot model submission.
        [https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengePractice](https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengePractice)
- Task 1 (‚úÖ Open): Detection of Generated Audio. Audio files are unmodified from the original output from the models or the pristine sources.
        [https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengeTask1](https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengeTask1)
- Task 2 (‚úÖ Open): Detection of Processed Audio. Audio files will be compressed with several common audio compression codecs. The audio files will also be resampled according to several sampling rates. Only the geneated files are augmented. The pristines remain the same.
        [https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengeTask2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengeTask2)
- Task 3 (‚úÖ Open): Detection of Laundered Audio. Audio files will be laundered to bypass detection. Only the geneated files are laundered. The pristines remain the same.
 	[https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengeTask3](https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengeTask3)



## üìà Data

The dataset will consist of human and machine generated speech audio tracks. 

- Human generated speech will be sourced from multiple sources and in multiple languages including but not limited to high quality in-studio and lower quality in-the-wild online recordings.
- Machine generated speech will be constructed using several SOTA TTS (text-to-speech) models. The models will be either open-source or closed-source.
- The audio files will vary in length but will be no longer than 60 seconds.
- Compression formats will also vary. (See practice submission and dataset on how to load the input data)
- The dataset will be balanced across sources. Each source (source of real audio and source of generated audio) will have an equal number of samples. 
- **This competition will be fully blind.** No data will be released. Only a small sample dataset will be released as part of a sample model.
  
## ü§ñ Model Submission

This is a script based competetion. No data will be released before the competition. A subset of the data may be released after the competition. We will be using [hugginface competions platform](https://github.com/huggingface/competitions).

### üìÇ Create Model Repo  
Participants will be required to submit their model to be evaluated on the dataset by creating a [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/new) model repository. Please use [the example model repo](https://huggingface.co/safe-challenge/safe-example-submission) as a template.
- **The model that you submit will remain private**. No one inlcuding the challenge organizers will have access to the model repo unless you decide to make the repo public.
- The model will be expected to read in the dataset and output file containing a **detection score, binary decision and inference time** for every input example.
- The dataset will be downloaded to `/tmp/data` inside the container during the evaluation run. See example model on how to load it.
- The only requirement is to have a `script.py` in the top level of the repo that saves a `submission.csv` file with the following columns. See [sample practice submission file](sample_practice_submission.csv).
  - `id` : id of the example, strig
  - `pred` : binary decision, string, "generated" or "pristine"
  - `score`: decision score such as log likelihood score. Postive scores correspond to generated and negative to pristine. (This is optional and not used in evaluation but will help with analysis later)  
  - `time` : inference time for every example in seconds
- All submissions will be evaluated using the same resources: NVIDIA `T4-medium` GPU instance. It has 8vCPUs, 30GB RAM, 16GB VRAM.
- All submissions will be evaluated in the same container that supports common ML frameworks and libraries:
  - Dockerfile: [https://github.com/huggingface/competitions/blob/main/Dockerfile](https://github.com/huggingface/competitions/blob/main/Dockerfile)
  - Docker Image: [https://hub.docker.com/r/huggingface/competitions/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/huggingface/competitions/tags)
  - Requirements File: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
  - If you'd like to add another package to the requirments file create an issue here: [https://github.com/stresearch/SAFE](https://github.com/stresearch/SAFE)
  - **During evalation, container will not have access to the internet**. Participants should include all other required dependencies in the model repo.
  - **üí° Remember: you can add anything to your model repo** like models, python packages, etc.

### üîò Submit  
Once your model is ready, it's time to submit:   
  - Go the task submision space (there is a seperate space for every task)
  - Login with your Huggingface Credentials
  - Teams consisting of multiple individuals should plan to submit under one Huggingface account to facilitate review and analysis results
  - Enter the name of your model e.g. `safe-challenge/safe-example-submission` and click submit! üéâ
  - Please use the same user name for all your submissions from the same team.

### üÜò Helpful Stuff

We provide an example model submission repo and a practice competition for troubleshooting.
- Take a look at an example model repo: [https://huggingface.co/safe-challenge/safe-example-submission](https://huggingface.co/safe-challenge/safe-example-submission)
- We encourage you to submit to a practice competition: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengePractice](https://huggingface.co/spaces/safe-challenge/SAFEChallengePractice)
- It's using this pracice dataset: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/safe-challenge/safe-challenge-practice-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/safe-challenge/safe-challenge-practice-dataset)
- üí° To reproduce all the steps in the submission locally, take a look at the debugging example: [debug example](debug_example.md)
- You won't be able to see any detailed error if your submission fails since it's run in a private space. *You can open a ticket or email us with your submission id, and we can look up the logs.* The easiest way is to trouble shoot locally using the above example.
- *üî•New* [Example on including a custom environment in your model repo](https://huggingface.co/safe-challenge/safe-example-submission-custom-env)

## üîç Evaluation

All submissions will be evalulated using balanced accuracy. Balanced accuracy is defined as an average of true positive rate and true negative rate. 

The competition page will maintain a public leaderboard and a private leaderboard. The data will be devided along the sources such that public leaderboard will be a subset of the private leaderboard. Public leaderboard will also show error rates for every source, However, the specific source name will be anonymized. For example, public leaderboard will show scores for 4 sources while the private leaderboard will be score on additional 4 sources for 8 sources total. See the following table as an example.

- After the competition closes, we will provide additional metrics broken down by source and other data attributes.
- This is why we ask you to provide a continous decision score for every input example in addition to a hard binary decision.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Rules
